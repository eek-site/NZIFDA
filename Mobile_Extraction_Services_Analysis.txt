ANALYSIS: Mobile Extraction Services - Legal and Compliance Issues

Date: December 2024
Prepared by: NZIFDA Regulatory Analysis

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

After reviewing the website content, New Zealand regulations, and compliance 
requirements, mobile extraction services for misfueled vehicles are likely 
ILLEGAL or NON-COMPLIANT with New Zealand law. All remediation must occur at 
certified fixed facilities.

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. DANGEROUS GOODS ACT 1974 - TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The website states: "Operators must hold a valid Dangerous Goods License to 
transport and handle contaminated fuel."

Critical Issues:
• Contaminated fuel is classified as a hazardous substance
• Transporting contaminated fuel requires:
  - Dangerous Goods License (specifically for transport)
  - Approved transport vehicles/containers
  - Proper labeling and packaging per EPA standards
  - Route planning and safety protocols

Mobile Service Problem:
Mobile extraction services would need to transport contaminated fuel from 
customer locations (fuel stations, roadsides, customer premises) back to 
disposal facilities. This triggers full Dangerous Goods transportation 
requirements, which are extremely difficult to comply with for mobile operations.

2. WASTE TRACKING DOCUMENTATION - POINT OF GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MfE Guidelines require complete tracking from generation to disposal.

Critical Issues:
• Waste tracking must begin at the point where contaminated fuel is generated
• Mobile extraction creates contaminated fuel at the customer location 
  (not a licensed facility)
• Transport must be documented immediately with proper forms
• Operator must be present at generation point to sign tracking documentation

Mobile Service Problem:
When mobile extraction occurs at a fuel station or customer location, the 
contaminated fuel is "generated" at that uncontrolled location. This creates 
significant compliance challenges:
- Generation occurs at unlicensed, uncontrolled locations
- Waste tracking forms must be completed on-site
- Transport documentation must begin immediately
- All parties must sign at the generation point

Fixed Facility Advantage:
When vehicles are towed to fixed facilities, the contaminated fuel generation 
can be properly documented at a licensed, controlled facility with proper 
containment and documentation systems.

3. EPA HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES REGULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPA requires proper storage, handling, and labeling of hazardous substances.

Critical Issues:
• Contaminated fuel must be stored in approved containers
• Proper labeling required at point of extraction
• Safety Data Sheets must be available
• Emergency response capability required

Mobile Service Problem:
Mobile operations would need:
- Approved storage containers on mobile vehicles
- Proper labeling at point of extraction (customer location)
- Safety Data Sheets available on-site
- Emergency response capability at variable, uncontrolled locations

Fixed Facility Advantage:
Fixed facilities provide controlled environments with proper containment, 
labeling systems, and emergency response equipment readily available.

4. CURRENT WEBSITE GUIDANCE IMPLIES FIXED FACILITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evidence from website content:

Emergency Response Page states:
"Step 3: Arrange Safe Transport - If the vehicle is at a fuel station, arrange 
for towing to the operator's facility."

Certification Page states:
"Step 3: Site Inspection - We conduct an on-site inspection of your facilities 
and equipment to verify equipment meets certification standards, facilities are 
properly maintained..."

Standards Page states:
"Fuel Extraction Protocol - Complete contaminated fuel removal using certified 
vacuum extraction systems per industry specifications."

These references all point to FIXED FACILITIES, not mobile services.

5. HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK REGULATIONS 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workplace safety requirements for handling hazardous substances.

Critical Issues:
• Risk assessments required for all work locations
• Proper PPE and safety protocols
• Emergency response procedures
• Controlled work environments

Mobile Service Problem:
Mobile work at variable locations creates:
- Uncontrolled environmental conditions
- Variable site safety factors
- Difficult emergency response planning
- Harder to enforce PPE and safety protocols
- Higher risk of accidents and spills

6. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CONCERNS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resource Management Act 1991 requires environmental protection.

Critical Issues:
• Spill containment and response
• Proper drainage and containment
• Environmental impact mitigation

Mobile Service Problem:
Mobile extraction at uncontrolled locations increases:
- Risk of spills at fuel stations, roadsides, customer premises
- Difficulty containing spills at variable locations
- Environmental contamination risk
- Compliance with Resource Management Act harder to ensure

7. PRACTICAL COMPLIANCE BARRIERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if technically possible, mobile services face:

Insurance:
- Higher insurance costs for mobile operations
- More complex liability coverage requirements

Licensing:
- Need both Dangerous Goods License for transport AND handling
- More complex licensing requirements

Waste Tracking:
- Must complete tracking forms at customer location
- More complex documentation requirements
- Harder to ensure compliance

Equipment:
- Mobile equipment harder to certify
- More complex maintenance and calibration
- Harder to ensure proper containment

Compliance Monitoring:
- NZIFDA must monitor operations at variable locations
- Harder to conduct inspections
- More difficult to verify compliance

================================================================================
LEGAL CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Mobile extraction services are likely ILLEGAL or NON-COMPLIANT because:

1. They require transporting hazardous waste (contaminated fuel) from 
   uncontrolled locations, which triggers full Dangerous Goods transportation 
   requirements that are extremely difficult to comply with for mobile operations.

2. Waste tracking must begin at the point of generation (customer location), 
   creating significant compliance challenges at uncontrolled, unlicensed locations.

3. Fixed facilities provide better control, safety, and regulatory compliance 
   - which is why the website already directs customers to fixed facilities.

4. The proper, compliant process is: Vehicle towed → Fixed facility → Extraction 
   → Proper disposal.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Update website to explicitly state that mobile extraction services are 
   NON-COMPLIANT

2. Clarify that all remediation must occur at certified fixed facilities

3. Update emergency response guidance to emphasize towing to facilities

4. Add to certification requirements that operators must have fixed facilities

5. Update standards to specify fixed facility requirements

6. Add FAQ entry explaining why mobile services are not permitted
